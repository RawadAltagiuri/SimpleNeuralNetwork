# SimpleNeuralNetwork
 A simple neural network to recognize handwritten digits, implemented from scratch using Python and NumPy. The dataset is MNIST, which is a widely used dataset for training and testing machine learning models. This particular one is obtained from this link [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer).

 You can either run this in visual studio code if you have the necessary extensions or run it on google colab or jupyter notebook.


To get started, you'll need to create a virtual environment, activate it, and install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory using the `cd` command. For example:
    ```
    cd /c:/your/directory/path/SimpleNeuralNetwork
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment using the following command:
    ```
    python -m venv myenv
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
      ```
      myenv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - On macOS and Linux:
      ```
      source myenv/bin/activate
      ```

5. Once the virtual environment is activated, you can install the dependencies recursively from the `requirements.txt` file using the following command:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
